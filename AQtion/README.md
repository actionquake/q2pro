Building for Microsoft Visual Studio
=====

AQtion now supports MSVC 2022.

First time use, create the build directories by running:
- meson_debug_configure.bat
- meson_release_configure.bat

This should create a AQtion/Debug and AQtion/Release directory.

Open AQtion.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

Compiling outputs to AQtion/AQtion/

You can copy your game assets to this directory to debug in MSVC
