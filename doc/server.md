# About

Q2PRO is an enhanced, multiplayer oriented Quake 2 server, compatible
with existing Quake 2 ports and licensed under GPLv2. This document
provides descriptions of console variables and commands added to or
modified by Q2PRO since the original Quake 2 release. Cvars and commands
inherited from original Quake 2 are not described here (yet).

# Variables

## Network

### net\_enable\_ipv6  
Enables IPv6 support. Default value is 1 on systems that support IPv6
and 0 otherwise.

-   0 — disable IPv6, use IPv4 only

-   1 — enable IPv6, but do not listen for incoming IPv6 connections and
    prefer IPv4 over IPv6 when resolving host names with multiple
    addresses

-   2 — enable IPv6, listen for incoming IPv6 connections and use normal
    address resolver priority configured by OS

### net\_ip  
Specifies network interface address server should listen on for UDP and
TCP connections using IPv4. The same interface is also used for outgoing
TCP connections (these include MVD/GTV and anticheat connections).
Default value is empty, which means listening on all interfaces.

There is a limitation preventing anticheat to work correctly on servers
accessible from multiple IP addresses. If you are running the server on
multi-ip system and plan to use anticheat, you need to explicitly bind
the server to one of your network interfaces using the ‘net\_ip’ cvar.

### net\_ip6  
Specifies network interface address server should listen on for UDP and
TCP connections using IPv6. The same interface is also used for outgoing
TCP connections (these include MVD/GTV connections). Default value is
empty, which means listening on all interfaces. Has no effect unless
‘net\_enable\_ipv6’ is set to non-zero value.

### net\_port  
Specifies port number server should listen on for UDP and TCP
connections (using IPv4 or IPv6). Default value is 27910.

### net\_ignore\_icmp  
On Win32 and Linux, server is able to receive ICMP
‘destination-unreachable’ packets from clients. This enables intelligent
detection of crashed clients, allowing the server to quickly re-use
their slots. If this behavior is not wanted for some reason, then this
variable can be used to turn it off. Default value is 0 (don’t ignore
ICMP packets).

### net\_maxmsglen  
Specifies maximum server to client packet size clients may request from
server. 0 means no hard limit. Default value is conservative 1390 bytes.
It is nice to have this variable as close to your network link MTU as
possible (accounting for headers). Thus for normal Ethernet MTU of 1500
bytes 1462 can be specified (10 bytes quake header, 8 bytes UDP header,
20 bytes IPv4 header). Higher values may cause IP fragmentation for
misconfigured clients which is better to avoid. Don’t change this
variable unless you know exactly what you are doing.

## Generic

### sv\_iplimit  
Maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed from single IP
address (per connection type, TCP and UDP client lists are separate).
Setting this variable to 0 disables the limit. Default value is 3.

### sv\_status\_show  
Specifies how the server should respond to status queries. Default value
is 2.

-   0 — do not respond at all

-   1 — respond with server info only

-   2 — respond with server info and player list

### sv\_status\_limit  
Limits the rate at which server responds to status queries. Default
value is 15 queries per second.

Rate limiting is implemented as a simple token bucket filter. Full
syntax for specifying rate limits is:
*&lt;limit&gt;\[/&lt;period&gt;\[sec|min|hour\]\]\[\*&lt;burst&gt;\]*.
Only the *limit* argument is mandatory. Zero *limit* means rate is not
limited.

Default period is one second. Custom *period* can be specified after a
slash, with optional *sec*, *min*, or *hour* suffix (default units are
seconds).

Default burst value is 5. Custom *burst* can be specified after an
asterisk. Burst specifies initial number of extra packets that are
permitted even if they arrive at rate higher than allowed.

### sv\_auth\_limit  
Limits the rate of client connection attempts with invalid password.
Default value is 1 invalid authentication attempt per second.

### sv\_rcon\_limit  
Limits the rate at which server responds to invalid rcon commands.
Default value is 1 invalid command per second.

### sv\_namechange\_limit  
Limits the rate at which clients are permitted to change their name.
Default value is 5 name changes per minute.

### sv\_password  
If not empty, allows only authenticated clients to connect.
Authenticated clients are allowed to occupy reserved slots, see below.
Clients set their passwords via ‘password’ userinfo variable. Default
value is empty (no password).

If password protection is needed for a server, it is preferable to use
‘sv\_password’ instead of going the game mod way and using ‘password’
variable. The latter will prevent MVD/GTV features from working.

If ‘sv\_password’ is set, then game mod’s ‘password’ variable must be
empty. Otherwise clients will be unable to connect.

### sv\_reserved\_slots  
Number of client slots reserved for clients who know
‘sv\_reserved\_password’ or ‘sv\_password’. Must be less than
‘maxclients’ value. Default value is 0 (don’t reserve slots).

If ‘sv\_mvd\_enable’ is non-zero and ‘sv\_reserved\_slots’ is zero,
‘sv\_reserved\_slots’ is automatically set to one to reserve a slot for
dummy MVD observer.

Value of ‘sv\_reserved\_slots’ cvar is subtracted from ‘maxclients’
value visible in the server info.

### sv\_reserved\_password  
The password to use for reserved slots. Default value is empty, which
means no one is allowed to occupy reserved slot(s), except of dummy MVD
observer. Clients set their passwords via ‘password’ userinfo variable.

### sv\_locked  
Locks the server, preventing new clients from connecting. Default value
is 0 (server unlocked).

### sv\_lan\_force\_rate  
When enabled, do not enforce any rate limits on clients whose IP is from
private address space (127.x.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 172.16.x.x).
Default value is 0 (disabled).

### sv\_min\_rate  
Specifies minimum value of ‘rate’ userinfo parameter clients are allowed
to use. Default value is 100 bytes/sec.

### sv\_max\_rate  
Specifies maximum value of ‘rate’ userinfo parameter clients are allowed
use. Default value is 15000 bytes/sec.

### sv\_calcpings\_method  
Specifies the way client pings are calculated. Default ping calculation
algorithm depends on client frame and packet rates, and may give
inaccurate results, depending on client settings. Using improved
algorithm is recommended as it should produce results more consistent
with ‘ping’ command line utility. Default value is 2.

-   0 — disable ping calculation entirely

-   1 — use default ping calculation algorithm based on averaging

-   2 — use improved algorithm based on minimum round trip times

### sv\_ghostime  
Maximum time, in seconds, before dropping clients which have passed
initial challenge-response connection stage but have not yet sent any
data over newly established connection. This also applies to MVD/GTV
clients in request processing stage. Helps to avoid attacks flooding
server with zombie clients, combined with ‘sv\_iplimit’ variable.
Default value is 6.

### sv\_idlekick  
Time, in seconds, before dropping inactive clients. Default value is 0
(don’t kick idling clients). Moving, pressing buttons while in game and
issuing chat commands counts as activity.

Don’t set ‘sv\_idlekick’ too low to avoid kicking clients that are
downloading or otherwise taking long time to enter the game.

### sv\_force\_reconnect  
When set to an address string, forces new clients to quickly reconnect
to this address as an additional proxy protection measure. Default value
is empty (do not enforce reconnection).

### sv\_redirect\_address  
When server becomes full, redirects new clients to the specified
address. Default value is empty (don’t redirect).

### sv\_downloadserver  
Specifies the URL clients should use for HTTP downloading. URL must
begin with a ‘http://’ or ‘https://’ prefix and must end with a slash.
Default value is empty (no download URL).

It is highly advisable to setup HTTP downloading on any public Quake 2
server. The easiest way to do so is to run
[pakserve](https://github.com/skullernet/pakserve) on the same machine
as Quake 2 server.

### sv\_show\_name\_changes  
Broadcast player name changes to everyone. Enable this unless game mod
already shows name changes. Default value is 0.

-   0 — don’t show name changes

-   1 — show name changes of players fully spawned in game

-   2 — show name changes of all players, including connecting players

### sv\_allow\_nodelta  
Enables automatic removal of clients that abuse the server with requests
for too many ‘nodelta’ (uncompressed) frames, hogging network resources.
Default value is 1 (don’t remove clients), since this may sometimes
legitimately happen on very poor client connections.

### sv\_allow\_unconnected\_cmds  
Controls whether client command strings are processed by the game mod
even when the client is not fully spawned in game. Originally, Quake 2
server forwarded all commands to the game mod even for connecting
clients, but this is known to cause problems with some (broken) mods
that don’t perform their own client state checks. Default value is 0
(ignore commands unless fully connected).

### sv\_uptime  
Include ‘uptime’ key/value pair in server info. Default value is 0.

-   0 — do not display uptime at all

-   1 — display uptime in compact format

-   2 — display uptime in verbose format

### sv\_enhanced\_setplayer  
Enable partial client name matching for certain console commands like
‘kick’ and ‘stuff’. Default value is 0 (use original matching
algorithm).

### sv\_recycle  
Temporary variable useful for automatically upgrading the server at the
next map change. Default value is 0.

-   0 — handle ‘gamemap’ command normally

-   1 — turn the next ‘gamemap’ into ‘map’ and reload the game module

-   2 — turn the next ‘gamemap’ into ‘recycle’ and reload entire server

Be sure to read ‘recycle’ command description below before enabling
‘sv\_recycle’.

### sv\_allow\_map  
Controls the ‘map’ command behavior. ‘map’ is often mistakingly used by
server operators to change maps instead of the more lightweight
‘gamemap’. Thus, this variable exists to prevent misuse of ‘map’.
Default value is 0.

-   0 — disallow ‘map’ and print a warning unless there are pending
    latched cvars

-   1 — handle ‘map’ command normally

-   2 — turn ‘map’ into ‘gamemap’ unless there are pending latched cvars

### sv\_changemapcmd  
Specifies command to be executed each time server finishes loading a new
map. Default value is empty.

### sv\_fps  
Specifies native server frame rate. Only used when game mod advertises
support for variable server FPS. Specified rate should be a multiple of
10 (maximum rate is 60). Default value is 10 frames per second. Only
clients that support Q2PRO protocol will be able to take advantage of
higher FPS. Other clients will receive updates at default rate of 10
packets per second.

lrcon\_password  
If not empty, enables users of this password to execute limited set of
rcon commands on the server. By default no commands are permitted.
Permitted command prefixes can be added using ‘addlrconcmd’.

### sv\_cinematics  
If set to 0, server will skip cinematics even if they exist. Default
value is 1.

### sv\_max\_packet\_entities  
Maximum number of entities in client frame. 0 means unlimited. Default
value is 128. Some non-standard maps with large open areas may need this
value increased. Consider however that default Quake 2 client can only
render 128 entities maximum. Other clients may support more.

## Downloads

These variables control legacy server UDP downloads.

### allow\_download  
Globally allows or disallows server UDP downloads. Remaining variables
listed below are effective only when downloads are globally enabled.
Default value is 0.

-   0 — downloads are disabled

-   1 — downloads are enabled

### allow\_download\_maps  
Enables downloading of files from ‘maps/’ subdirectory. Default value is
1.

-   0 — map downloads are disabled

-   1 — map downloads are enabled for physical files and disabled for
    files from packs

-   2 — map downloads are enabled for all files

### allow\_download\_models  
Enables downloading of files from ‘models/’ and ‘sprites/’
subdirectories. Default value is 1.

### allow\_download\_sounds  
Enables downloading of files from ‘sound/’ subdirectory. Default value
is 1.

### allow\_download\_pics  
Enables downloading of files from ‘pics/’ subdirectory. Default value is
1.

### allow\_download\_players  
Enables downloading of files from ‘players/’ subdirectory. Default value
is 1.

### allow\_download\_textures  
Enables downloading of files from ‘textures/’ and ‘env/’ subdirectories.
Default value is 1.

### allow\_download\_others  
Enables downloading of files from any subdirectory other than those
listed above. Default value is 0.

### sv\_max\_download\_size  
Maximum size of UDP download in bytes. Value of 0 disables the limit.
Default value is 8388608 (8 MiB).

Q2PRO clients can stream compressed downloads directly from .pkz
archives on the server. Thus it is advisable to keep all data in .pkz
for optimal download speeds.

## MVD/GTV server

Q2PRO server can run in either MVD/GTV ‘server’ or ‘client’ mode.
‘Server’ mode is just a regular game server mode. In this mode, server
functions as a primary source of MVD data, which can be either locally
recorded to disk in form of a demo file, or sent to GTV clients over the
network. ‘Client’ mode is more special. In this mode, game mod is not
run and server acts as a GTV ‘relay’ node, reading MVD data from local
demo files, receiving live data from remote GTV servers, or both at the
same time. MVD data is then served to regular Quake 2 clients
(spectators).

As a convention, cvars related to server mode have ‘sv\_mvd\_’ prefix.
Cvars related to client mode have ‘mvd\_’ prefix (see the next section).

### sv\_mvd\_enable  
Enables MVD/GTV server functionality. Default value is 0.

-   0 — MVD server is disabled

-   1 — local MVD recording is allowed

-   2 — local MVD recording and remote GTV connections are allowed

### sv\_mvd\_maxclients  
Total number of MVD/GTV client slots on the server. Default value is 8.

### sv\_mvd\_password  
If not empty, allows only authenticated MVD/GTV clients to connect.
Default value is empty (any neutral host can connect).

Password check only applies to MVD/GTV clients that are neither
whitelisted nor blacklisted (see ‘addgtvhost’ and ‘addgtvban’ commands
description for more information).

### sv\_mvd\_nogun  
Reduce bandwidth usage by filtering on-screen gun updates out of MVD
stream. Default value is 0 (filtering disabled).

### sv\_mvd\_noblend  
Reduce bandwidth usage by filtering on-screen blend effects out of MVD
stream. Default value is 0 (filtering disabled).

### sv\_mvd\_nomsgs  
When enabled, MVD/GTV spectators in chasecam mode will not receive any
text messages routed to their chase targets (which are normally on a
team), but will receive messages routed to the dummy MVD observer.
Default value is 1 (enabled). This variable is only effective when dummy
client is spawned, see ‘sv\_mvd\_spawn\_dummy’ variable description for
more information.

### sv\_mvd\_maxtime  
Maximum duration, in minutes, of the locally recorded MVD. Default value
is 0 (unlimited).

### sv\_mvd\_maxsize  
Maximum size, in kB, of the locally recorded MVD. Default value is 0
(unlimited).

### sv\_mvd\_maxmaps  
Specifies number of map changes local MVD recording is stopped after.
Default value is 1. Setting this to 0 disables the limit.

### sv\_mvd\_begincmd  
This command is issued on behalf of dummy MVD observer as soon as it
enters the game. Do whatever preparations are needed here to make sure
MVD observer enters an appropriate observing mode, opens the scoreboard,
etc. MVD observer has it’s own command buffer and each ‘wait’ cycle
lasts 100 ms there. Default value is "wait 50; putaway; wait 10; help;".

### sv\_mvd\_scorecmd  
This command is issued on behalf of dummy MVD observer each time no
layout updates are detected for more than 9 seconds. Useful for
reopening the scoreboard if the game mod closes it for some reason. MVD
observer has its own command buffer and each ‘wait’ cycle lasts 100 ms
there. Default value is "putaway; wait 10; help;".

### sv\_mvd\_suspend\_time  
GTV connections are suspended after this period of time, in minutes,
counted from the moment last active player disconnects or becomes
inactive. Setting this to zero disables server side suspending entirely.
Default value is 5.

### sv\_mvd\_disconnect\_time  
Dummy MVD observer is disconnected after this period of time, in
minutes, counted from the moment last GTV client disconnects or becomes
inactive. Setting this to zero makes dummy client persistent. Default
value is 15.

### sv\_mvd\_spawn\_dummy  
Specifies if dummy MVD observer needs to be spawned. Default value is 1.

-   0 — never spawn dummy client

-   1 — only spawn if game mod advertises support for MVD

-   2 — always spawn dummy client

## MVD/GTV client

### mvd\_username  
Default username to use for outgoing GTV connections. Default value is
"unnamed".

### mvd\_password  
Default password to use for outgoing GTV connections. Default value is
empty.

### mvd\_timeout  
Specifies MVD connection timeout value, in seconds. Default value is 90.

### mvd\_suspend\_time  
GTV connections are suspended after this period of time, in minutes,
counted from the last moment of MVD spectator(s) activity. Setting this
to zero disables client side suspending entirely. Default value is 5.

### mvd\_wait\_delay  
Time, in seconds, for MVD channel to buffer data initially. This
effectively specifies MVD stream delay seen by observers. Default value
is 20.

### mvd\_wait\_percent  
Maximum inuse percentage of the delay buffer when MVD channel stops
buffering data to prevent overrun, ignoring ‘mvd\_wait\_delay’ value.
Default value is 50.

### mvd\_buffer\_size  
Size of delay buffer, in multiplies of MAX\_MSGLEN (32 KiB). Default
value is 8. You may need to increase this when also increasing
‘mvd\_wait\_delay’.

### mvd\_default\_map  
Specifies default map used for the Waiting Room channel. Default value
is "q2dm1".

### mvd\_chase\_prefix  
Specifies POV info string position on the screen. This should be a valid
fragment of the Quake 2 layout script. Default value is "xv 0 yb -64".

### mvd\_stats\_score  
Specifies what ‘score’ stats field should contain for MVD observers.
This field is externally visible to server browsers. Default value is 0.

-   0 — always zero

-   1 — MVD channel ID spectator is on

-   2 — score of the chase target

### mvd\_snaps  
Specifies time interval, in seconds, between saving ‘snapshots’ in
memory during MVD playback. Snapshots enable backward seeking in demo
(see ‘mvdseek’ command description), and speed up repeated forward
seeks. Setting this variable to 0 disables snapshotting entirely.
Default value is 10.

## Hacks

### sv\_strafejump\_hack  
Enables FPS-independent strafe jumping mode for clients using R1Q2 and
Q2PRO protocols. Values higher than 1 will force this mode for all
clients, regardless of their protocol version. Default value is 1
(enable strafe jumping hack only for compatible clients).

### sv\_waterjump\_hack  
Makes underwater movement speed equal in all directions for clients
using Q2PRO protocol. Values higher than 1 will force this mode for all
clients, regardless of their protocol version. Default value is 1
(enabled).

Quake 2 player movement code contains a bug that causes surfacing
velocity produced by holding the jump button underwater to be severely
limited, comparing to movement in other directions. Even worse,
resulting velocity is calculated differently on client and server sides
and that causes prediction errors and jerky movement. Q2PRO is able to
work around this bug and make player movement speed equal in all
directions underwater.

## System

### sys\_console  
On UNIX-like systems, specifies how system console is initialized.
Default value is 2 if both stdin and stdout descriptors refer to a TTY,
1 if running a dedicated server and 0 otherwise.

-   0 — don’t write anything to stdout and don’t read anything from
    stdin

-   1 — print to stdout and read commands from stdin, but don’t assume
    it is a terminal

-   2 — enable command line editing and colored text output

The following key bindings are available in Windows console and in TTY
console when command line editing is enabled:

-   HOME, Ctrl+A — move cursor to start of line

-   END, Ctrl+E — move cursor to end of line

-   Left arrow, Ctrl+B — move cursor one character left

-   Right arrow, Ctrl+F — move cursor one character right

-   Alt+B — move cursor one word left

-   Alt+F — move cursor one word right

-   DEL, Ctrl+D — delete character under cursor

-   Backspace, Ctrl+H — delete character left of cursor

-   Ctrl+W — delete word left of cursor

-   Ctrl+U — delete all characters left of cursor

-   Ctrl+K — delete all characters right of cursor

-   Ctrl+L — erase screen

-   Ctrl+C — quit

-   Down arrow, Ctrl+N — next line in command history

-   Up arrow, Ctrl+P — previous line in command history

-   Ctrl+R — reverse search in command history

-   Ctrl+S — forward search in command history

-   Tab — complete command

In Windows console additional key bindings are supported:

-   PGUP — scroll console buffer up

-   PGDN — scroll console buffer down

-   Ctrl+PGUP — scroll to console top

-   Ctrl+PGDN — scroll to console bottom

### sys\_parachute  
On UNIX-like systems, specifies if a fatal termination handler is
installed. Default value is 1, which means Q2PRO will do some cleanup
when it crashes, like restoring terminal settings. However, this will
prevent core dump from being generated. To enable core dumps, set this
variable to 0.

### sys\_forcegamelib  
Specifies the full path to the game library server should attempt to
load first, before normal search paths are tried. Useful mainly for
debugging or mod development. Default value is empty (use normal search
paths).

## Console Logging

### logfile  
Specifies if console logging to file is enabled. Default value is 0.

-   0 — logging disabled

-   1 — logging enabled, overwrite previous file

-   2 — logging enabled, append to previous file

Log file is not automatically reopened when game directory is changed.

### logfile\_flush  
Specifies if log file data is buffered in memory or flushed to disk
immediately. Default value is 0. See setvbuf(3) manual page for more
details.

-   0 — system default mode (block buffered)

-   1 — line buffered mode

-   2 — unbuffered mode

### logfile\_name  
Specifies base name of the log file. Should not include any extension
part or path components. ‘logs/’ prefix and ‘.log’ suffix are
automatically appended. Default value is ‘console’.

### logfile\_prefix  
Specifies the time/date template each line of log file is prefixed with.
Default value is ‘\[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\] ’. See strftime(3) manual page for
syntax description. In addition, the first ‘@’ character in the
template, if found, is replaced with a single character representing
message type (T — talk, D — developer, W — warning, E — error, N —
notice, A — default).

### console\_prefix  
Analogous to ‘logfile\_prefix’, but for system console. Additionally,
sequence ‘&lt;?&gt;’, if present at the beginning of prefix, is replaced
with printk()-style severity level based on message type. This is
intended for logging server stdout with systemd(1). Default value is
empty (no prefix).

## Miscellaneous

### map\_override\_path  
Specifies the directory from which override files with extensions ‘.ent’
or ‘.bsp.override’ are loaded. Default value is empty (don’t try to
override entity strings). Typical value for this is ‘maps’, but can be
customized per server port.

Override files with ‘.ent’ extension allow the entity string of the map
being loaded to be replaced by a custom data supplied by server
operator. This makes it possible to change the layout of entities on the
map (thus creating a new version of the map) without requiring clients
to download anything. Entity string can be dumped from the current map
using ‘dumpents’ server command and later changed with a text editor.

Override files with ‘.bsp.override’ extension are more complex: they are
binary files that can replace map entity string or checksum. They can
also create an alias for the map. How to create such files is out of
scope of this manual (search the internet for ‘r1q2 map override file
generator’).

This is togglable with `sv_load_ent` -- default enabled (`1`), a setting of
`0` will disable loading overrides of either type

### map\_visibility\_patch  
Attempt to patch miscalculated visibility data for some well-known maps
(q2dm1, q2dm3 and q2dm8 are patched so far), fixing disappearing walls
and entities. Default value is 1 (enabled).

### com\_fatal\_error  
Turns all non-fatal errors into fatal errors that cause server process
exit. Default value is 0 (disabled).

### com\_debug\_break  
Development variable that turns all errors into debug breakpoints.
Default value is 0 (disabled).

### g\_protocol\_extensions
Server operators can enable protocol extensions, which is not compatible with
clients that do not have protocol extensions.  The benefit is that
the limits around items such as sounds, images, map sizes and such are
significantly heightened.

### addfiltercmd &lt;command&gt; \[ignore|log|print|stuff|kick\] \[comment …\]  
Prevents client *command* otherwise unknown to the server from being
interpreted by the game mod, and takes the specified action instead. For
*print* and *stuff* actions *comment* argument is mandatory, and should
contain data to print and stuff to the client. For *kick* action
*comment* specifies optional disconnect reason printed to the client.
Default action is *ignore*. Commands are matched in a case-insensitive
way.

### delfiltercmd &lt;id|name|all&gt;  
Deletes command identified by numeric *id* or by *name* from the list of
filtered commands. You can also specify *all* to clear the whole
filtercmd list.

comments.

### addcvarban &lt;cvar&gt; &lt;match&gt; \[log|print|stuff|kick\] \[comment\]  
Adds an automatic check for specified *cvar*. Cvar value on the client
is compared with *match* and specified action is taken if value matches.
For *print* and *stuff* actions *comment* argument is mandatory, and
should contain data to print and stuff to the client. For *kick* action
*comment* specifies optional disconnect reason printed to the client.
Default action is *log*. See below for description of *match* string
syntax. Multiple entries with the same *cvar* are permitted and are
matched sequentially (stopping at the first entry with *kick* action
that matched).

### delcvarban &lt;id|cvar|all&gt;

compared with *match* and specified action is taken if value matches.
For *print* and *stuff* actions *comment* argument is mandatory, and
should contain data to print and stuff to the client. For *kick* action
*comment* specifies optional disconnect reason printed to the client.
Default action is *log*. See below for description of *match* string
syntax. Multiple entries with the same *key* are permitted and are
matched sequentially (stopping at the first entry with *kick* action
that matched). Matched userinfo bans with *kick* action also prevent new
clients from connecting.

### deluserinfoban &lt;id|key|all&gt;

userinfo bans matching *key*. You can also specify *all* to delete all
userinfo bans.

### listuserinfobans  
Enumerates all userinfobans along with appropriate actions and comments.

Full syntax for match string is:
*\[!\]\[\*|=|&lt;|&gt;|~|#\]\[num|str\]*. The following special
characters are recognized at the beginning of the string:

-   ! — negates the check

-   \* — matches if value is not empty

-   = — matches if numerical value is equal to *num*

-   &lt; — matches if numerical value is less than *num*

-   &gt; — matches if numerical value is greater than *num*

-   ~ — matches if value substring matches *str* literally

-   \# — escape character (*str* is matched literally)

If match string begins with any other character, it is matched
literally. All string comparsions are case-insensitive.

### addlrconcmd &lt;command&gt;

times.

### quit \[reason …\]  
Exit the server, sending ‘disconnect’ message to clients. Optional
*reason* string may be provided instead of the default ‘Server quit’
message.

### recycle \[reason …\]  
This command is equivalent to ‘quit’, with an exception that ‘reconnect’
message is sent to clients instead of ‘disconnect’. Useful for quickly
upgrading the server binary without losing clients, assuming the server
process is automatically restarted after it exits.

## MVD/GTV server

### mvdrecord \[-hz\] &lt;filename&gt;  
Start local MVD recording into ‘demos/*filename*.mvd2’.

-h | --help  
display help message

-z | --compress  
compress file with gzip

### mvdstop  
Stop local MVD recording.

### mvdstuff &lt;text&gt;

allow entire subnetwork.

### delgtvhost &lt;address\[/mask\]|id|all&gt;  
Deletes exactly matching *address*/*mask* pair from the white list of
trusted MVD/GTV hosts. You can also specify numeric *id* of the
address/mask pair to delete, or use special keyword *all* to clear the
entire list.

### listgtvhosts  
Displays all address/mask pairs added to the white list of trusted
MVD/GTV hosts along with their IDs.

White list of MVD/GTV hosts takes precedence over black list.
Whitelisted hosts are not required to know ‘sv\_mvd\_password’ even if
it is set.

### addgtvban &lt;address\[/mask\]&gt;  
Adds specified *address* to the black list of banned MVD/GTV hosts
disallowed to connect to this server. Specify *mask* to ban entire
subnetwork.

### delgtvban &lt;address\[/mask\]|id|all&gt;

banned MVD/GTV hosts. You can also specify numeric *id* of the
address/mask pair to delete, or use special keyword *all* to clear the
entire list.

### listgtvbans  
Displays all address/mask pairs added to the black list of banned
MVD/GTV hosts along with their IDs.

## MVD/GTV client

MVD/GTV client command interface operates with ‘channel’ and
‘connection’ objects. Typically, there is one-to-one correspondence
between them, but this is not always the case. Connection is a
persistent handle to the remote GTV server, while MVD channel, which
represents a world state seen by the observers, has a shorter lifetime.
Channels are automatically created once there is some data available on
the connection and destroyed once connection is suspended by server and
all buffered data have been read. A demo playback channel is special in
a way that is does not have a parent connection.

Both *connections* and *channels* can be identified by their name or by
unique ID number seen in the output of ‘mvdservers’ and ‘mvdchannels’
commands. Channels inherit names and IDs from their parent connections.

### mvdconnect \[-hn:u:p:\] &lt;address\[:port\]&gt;  
Create connection to the GTV server at the given *address*. If *port* is
omitted, default server port 27910 is used.

-h | --help  
display help message

-n | --name=&lt;string&gt;  
specify channel name as *string*, default is ‘netX’

-u | --user=&lt;string&gt;  
specify username as *string*, default is to use value of ‘mvd\_username’
cvar

-p | --pass=&lt;string&gt;  
specify password as *string*, default is to use value of ‘mvd\_password’
cvar

### mvdisconnect \[-ah\] \[connection\]  
Destroy the specified GTV server *connection* or all connections. If
there is an associated MVD channel, any buffered data is replayed to
spectators, then MVD channel is destroyed. There is no need to specify
*connection* if there is only one active connection.

-a | --all  
destroy all connections

-h | --help  
display help message

### mvdkill \[channel\]  
Destroy the specified MVD *channel* (any parent GTV connection is also
destroyed). There is no need to specify *channel* if there is only one
active channel.

### mvdplay \[-hl:n:r:\] &lt;\[/\]filename&gt; \[…\]  
Begins MVD playback from the file identified by *filename* by creating a
new MVD channel. This command does not require file extension to be
specified and supports filename autocompletion on TAB. Loads file from
‘demos/’ unless slash is prepended to *filename*, otherwise loads from
the root of quake file system. Multiple *filenames* can be specified to
create a playlist.

-h | --help  
display help message

-l | --loop=&lt;number&gt;  
replay *number* of times (0 means forever, replays once by default)

-n | --name=&lt;string&gt;  
specify channel name as *string*, default is ‘demX’

-r | --replace=&lt;channel&gt;  
replace existing *channel* playlist with new entries, don’t create a new
channel

### mvdseek \[+-\]&lt;timespec|percent&gt;\[%\] \[channel\]  
Seeks the given amount of time during MVD playback on the specified
*channel*. Prepend with ‘+’ to seek forward relative to current
position, prepend with ‘-’ to seek backward relative to current
position. Without prefix, seeks to an absolute frame position within the
MVD file, counted from the last map change. See below for *timespec*
syntax description. With ‘%’ suffix, seeks to specified file position
percentage. Initial forward seek may be slow, so be patient. For
multi-map recordings, it is not possible to return to the previous map
by seeking. Seeking during demo recording is not yet supported.

Absolute or relative MVD time can be specified in one of the following
formats:

-   .FF, where FF are frames

-   SS, where SS are seconds

-   SS.FF, where SS are seconds, FF are frames

-   MM:SS, where MM are minutes, SS are seconds

-   MM:SS.FF, where MM are minutes, SS are seconds, FF are frames

### mvdrecord \[-hz\] &lt;filename&gt; \[channel\]  
Start MVD recording on the specified *channel* into
‘demos/*filename*.mvd2’. There is no need to specify *channel* if there
is only one active channel.

-h | --help  
display help message

-z | --compress  
compress file with gzip

With Q2PRO it is possible to record a demo while playing back another
one.

### mvdstop \[channel\]  
Stop MVD recording on the specified channel. There is no need to specify
*channel* if there is only one active channel.

As you have probably noticed, the same ‘mvdrecord’ and ‘mvdstop’
commands introduced in the previous section are used here. This is
possible since Q2PRO server may be either in the MVD/GTV server or
client mode, but not both at the same time.

### mvdspawn  
Put the server into MVD/GTV mode, creating the Waiting Room channel.
This command performs a full server restart. Done automatically as soon
as the first GTV connection is established or local MVD file is
replayed.

### mvdchannels \[mode\]  
List all MVD channels (there may be none, if all GTV connections are
suspended). Optional *mode* argument may be provided to show different
kind of information.

r(ecordings)  
show MVD recording status

mvdservers  
List all GTV connections.

# Incompatibilities

Q2PRO server tries to be compatible with other Quake 2 ports, including
original Quake 2 release. Compatibility, however, is defined in terms of
full file format and network protocol compatibility. Q2PRO is not meant
to be a direct replacement of your regular Quake 2 server. Some features
are implemented differently in Q2PRO, some may be not implemented at
all. You may need to review your config and adapt it for Q2PRO. This
section tries to document most of these incompatibilities so that when
something doesn’t work as it used to be you know where to look. The
following list may be incomplete.

-   ‘ip’ variable has been renamed to ‘net\_ip’.

-   ‘port’ variable has been renamed to ‘net\_port’, and ‘ip\_hostport’
    and ‘hostport’ aliases are no longer supported.

-   ‘serverrecord’ and ‘demomap’ commands has been removed in favor of
    ‘mvdrecord’ and ‘mvdplay’.

-   On Windows, ‘./release/gamex86.dll’ path will not be tried by
    default when loading the game DLL. If you need this for loading some
    sort of a game mod proxy, use ‘sys\_forcegamelib’ variable.

-   Q2PRO works only with virtual paths constrained to the quake file
    system. All paths are normalized before use so that it is impossible
    to go past virtual filesystem root using ‘../’ components. This
    means commands like these are equivalent and all reference the same
    file: ‘exec ../global.cfg’, ‘exec /global.cfg’, ‘exec global.cfg’.
    If you have any config files in your Quake 2 directory root, you
    should consider moving them into ‘baseq2/’ to make them accessible.

-   Likewise, ‘link’ command syntax has been changed to work with
    virtual paths constrained to the quake file system. All arguments to
    ‘link’ are normalized.
